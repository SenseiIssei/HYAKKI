# Roadmap — 50 more yōkai, new biomes, and music that changes with the road

_Status: plan. Nothing here is built yet. This is the shape of the next content
push, grounded in the systems that already exist so each piece is a small,
mechanical addition rather than a rewrite._

## The three systems this touches (and why it's cheap)

Everything below plugs into three tables that were built to be extended:

1. **`src/pixel/species.ts` → `SPECIES[]`.** A monster is one `build(seed, phase)`
   function (a character-grid sprite that animates on `phase ∈ [0,1)`) plus one
   table row (`id, name, kanji, family, from, weight, fps, lore, build`). No
   other file has to change for a new enemy to spawn, animate, colour-shift and
   show its Register line. The five combat **families** — `chaff` (fast, weak,
   many), `organs` (slow bruisers), `returned` (ghosts), `nothing` (voids),
   `warden` (the Ten Kings / bosses) — already carry attack animations, spark
   colours, and death dissolves, so a new species inherits its whole feel from
   the family it declares.

2. **`src/ui/Backdrop.tsx` → `REGIONS[]`.** A biome is one row: `id, from, name`,
   and a five-colour palette (`sky[2], far, mid, near`). `regionFor(rank)` picks
   it by depth; the parallax layers and fog redraw themselves. Adding a biome is
   one entry — the comment already says so.

3. **`src/audio/` → `engine.ts` (`setAmbience`) + `music.ts`.** Ambience already
   cross-fades per region. Music does **not** yet change with the region — it is
   one mode (the _in_ scale 陰音階 on D) everywhere. That is the gap this roadmap
   closes: **each biome gets its own musical mode and instrumentation.**

**Economy-safety rule (unbreakable):** signature/gear/enemy stats may touch
damage, crit, survival, speed, and _feel_ — never `bf/af/omen` or any income
multiplier. New content is measured against the prestige harness before merge
(the Ri 50→170→732 no-runaway check), exactly as gear was in Phase 7.

## Part A — six new biomes, interleaved with the six that exist

Existing: Bamboo Road (0), Emptied Village (60), Thousand Gates (160), The River
/ Sanzu (320), The Burning Ground / Jigoku (700), Without Interval / Muken
(2000).

New biomes slot **between** them so the road keeps changing, roughly every
40–120 ranks early and widening later. `from` values are proposals; final values
get tuned against pacing.

| # | id | name | from | mood / palette direction |
|---|----|------|------|--------------------------|
| B1 | `paddies` | The Drowned Paddies | 30 | flat black water, a low green mist, frog-song |
| B2 | `market` | The Night Market | 110 | lantern-red, crowded, too many lights for how empty it is |
| B3 | `snow` | The Snow Country | 230 | white-out, blue shadow, the cold that the Yuki-onna keeps |
| B4 | `aokigahara` | The Sea of Trees | 460 | no wind, no birds, roots and rope, green-black |
| B5 | `bridges` | The Hundred-Bridge Marsh | 900 | fog over black planks, will-o'-wisps, the River's edge going wrong |
| B6 | `togen` | The Iron Wastes | 1400 | between Jigoku and Muken — rust, slag, cooling metal, dull orange |

Each new biome ships with: one palette row in `REGIONS`, one ambience voice id in
`setAmbience`, one music mode (Part C), and its share of the 50 monsters (Part B).

## Part B — the fifty

Named where real folklore gives a name; the deepest hells invent where it must.
Each line: **NAME 漢字** — `family` · biome · one-line hook (the sprite/attack idea).

### The Bamboo Road & Drowned Paddies (early — chaff-heavy, teach the families)
1. **Konaki-jijī 子泣き爺** — `chaff` · bamboo · a crying infant that turns to stone weight when picked up; lunges then goes heavy.

50. **Yatō 夜藤 (the Night-Wisteria)** — `warden` · muken · an invented final court for Without Interval: a King made of every road that came before; the capstone fight.

Weighting/`from` per row gets tuned so each biome introduces 2–3 new faces while
older ones thin out, keeping the road a crowd, never a clone army.

## Part C — music that changes with the biome

Today `music.ts` is one mode (_in_ scale on D) plus koto/taiko/breath voices.
The change: a **mode table keyed by region**, switched the same moment
`setAmbience` fires. Japanese scale practice gives us real, distinct colours —
this is not random transposition, it's the right modes for the place.

| biome | mode (scale) | intervals from root | instrumentation shift | feeling |
|-------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|---------|
| bamboo | **in** 陰 | 0,1,5,7,8 | koto sparse, breath | the dark default, unease held |
| paddies | **yo** 陽 | 0,2,5,7,9 | koto + a low frog-thump | brighter, but wrong-bright |
| village | **miyako-bushi / in** | 0,1,5,7,8 | koto muted, shamisen pluck | abandoned, dry |
| market | **ryo** 呂 | 0,2,4,7,9 | shamisen lead, faster taiko | crowded, feverish |
| shrine | **hirajōshi** 平調子 | 0,2,3,7,8 | koto open tuning, bells | rite, gold, waiting |
| snow | **kumoi** 雲井 | 0,2,3,7,9 | koto high, breath, no drum | white silence, thin air |
| aokigahara | **iwato** 岩戸 | 0,1,5,6,10 | detuned koto, no pulse | no wind, no exit |
| sanzu | **insen** 陰旋 | 0,1,5,7,10 | koto + water, slow taiko | the crossing |
| bridges | **iwato (low)** | 0,1,5,6,10 | sub-drone, wisps | fog, one plank at a time |
| jigoku | **chromatic descent** | 0,1,2,3… | taiko dominant, brass-ish rasp | the burning, tempo climbs with Ri |
| iron | **in + tritone drone** | 0,1,5,7,8 + ♭5 pedal | anvil percussion | forge, metal cooling |
| muken | **single held cluster** | root + ♭2 + ♭5 | almost no melody, breath only | without interval — nearly no music at all |

Implementation: add `musicForRegion(regionId)` in `music.ts` that swaps the
active `SCALE` array and a small `voices` config; call it from the same place
`setAmbience` is called (`Column.tsx` region effect). Cross-fade the melodic
layer over ~2s so the mode-change lands as you walk into the new place, not as a
hard cut. Depth still intensifies _within_ a biome (tempo, the wrong-note
semitone) exactly as it does now — biome sets the colour, Ri sets the pressure.

---

## Suggested phasing (ship in increments, each self-contained)

- **P1 — Music modes (no new art).** Add `musicForRegion` + the mode table for
  the **six existing** biomes. Biggest feel-per-line change; ships alone.
- **P2 — Six new biomes.** Palette rows + ambience ids + their music modes. The
  road visibly changes more often.
- **P3 — Bestiary wave 1 (early 20).** Bamboo/Paddies/Village/Market species.
- **P4 — Bestiary wave 2 (mid 20).** Shrine/Snow/Aokigahara/Sanzu species.
- **P5 — Bestiary wave 3 + new bosses (final 10).** The mini-wardens and the
  Muken capstone (Yatō), each measured against the prestige harness.
- **P6 — Register/lore + i18n pass** for everything new (navigable strings only;
  narrative stays written English per the existing i18n scope decision).

Every wave: `tsc -b` clean, the bestiary distinctness + animation test green (no
two species share a silhouette, none renders static), and the economy harness
unchanged.
